Hi, I'm Ally Miley! I'm a 2018 grad of Loyola University Chicago's Bioinformatics and Computer Science programs who has been working as a data analyst in consulting as well as internal IT since graduating.

I am working to pivot into working with biological data again, so in an effort to reengage my brain in problems relating to this data, I've started working through Rosalind's Bioinformatics Stronghold.

I don't believe my code will start off looking elegant or simplistic, but I'm hoping I can look back in a year and scoff at my unnecessarily complex solutions in the same manner that most of you live viewers likely will.

I hope that by the end of this endeavor, I'll have a better idea of how to formulate my own independent project using some sort of biological data! 

I know that I'm interested in interacting with what I've defined as ~meaningful or interesting data (data that informs product design that could change lives (pharmaceutical/healthcare adjacent)), but beyond doing brain teasers with fun data, my goals are nonspecific.

I hope to narrow them over the course of this GitHub!

I'll collaborate on ANYTHING relating to biological/scientific data, PLEASE hit me up if you have anything related to this!
